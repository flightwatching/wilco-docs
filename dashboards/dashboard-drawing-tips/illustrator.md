## Download the SVG

In the edit page of the dashboard you can get into your computer the latest version of the SVG by clicking _download SVG._ The SVG should now be in your default download folder (`<name-of-dashboard>.svg`)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is a good practice to duplicate the current SVG in case you want to revert back to the version. Version management on SVG is not yet accessible to end user in WILCO and you'd need to call the support

## Open the SVG in Illustrator

Double click, what else....

## Modify the SVG file

It is important to understand that Illustrator has its own proprietary format (`.ai`). We are working here with SVG format which is the [official standardized format](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/). It happens that Illustrator adds its own layers and clipping masks. It should not have any impact

{% hint style="info" %}
As Illustrator has its own proprietary format, the exports to the standard format has glitches sometimes

## Saving the SVG file on your desktop

SVG saving options is very important to comply with WILCO. Here are the options that you should stick with. If Illustrator does not propose them, they may be OK. If not, you can `save as` and Illustrator will ask you for those options

The most important part is `attributs de pr√©sentation` or `presentation attributes` for the CSS properties. It will allow you to change the colors, position, size, etc...

## Update the SVG in WILCO

In the edit page of the dashboard, click on import and save. The new dashboard will be in place. You can verfy it works fine by verifying the `_anim` are present in the list of buttons and that the size of the dashboard is correct and identical to the illustrator one.
