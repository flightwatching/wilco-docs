# draw some zones

A zone helps to split the graph into zones. Zones are between 2 X values `drawZone(zones)`

* `zones` is an array of zone objects
  * `color`: the color of the zone as web color or RGB hex \(will be a little bit transparent\)
  * `size`: the font-size to apply on the `sn` text \(css size\)
  * `sn`: a short text that will be displayed vertically onto the border of the zone
  * `extent`: an array of 2 dates/numbers which are the X min and the X max values of the zone
