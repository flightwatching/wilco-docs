# Libraries

some useful libraries are included in the IFTs. You can use it:

* [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) to handle arrays \(search, filter, sort...\)
* [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/API-Reference.md) to access and animate your dashboard
* [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) to handle dates
* [jquery](http://api.jquery.com/) to navigate in the DOM structure of your dashboard \(deprecated\)

WILCO provides context related variables to the rules so that the dashboard is animated according to it.
