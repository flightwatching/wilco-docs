# Use the tags

You can use the tags on events even if they are not numbers. Each time we find a tag, then 1 is associated to it.

Tags are accessible as special parameters that starts with the keyword `__TAG_`

```javascript
//plots the tag ITM36
return __TAG_ITM36;
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Tags are often used as conditions in formulas or as dots overlays
{% endhint %}
