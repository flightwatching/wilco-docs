# show cleared

In the timeline header click on SHOW CLEARED, to see all the messages including the ones that were cleared.

In our example, choose first to see only warnings: click on button WARNINGS and then button SHOW CLEARED:

The previously cleared warning appears as a DOT on the timeline. Click on that DOT to show the message that was cleared:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 09.14.50.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>dismissed message</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Recall dismissed warnings in the timeline

Dismissed message can be recalled. Just as to [_clear the warning_](warnings.md) _,_ open the message by clicking on the arrow on right side of the box. Then, click on RECALL button and SAVE:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 09.18.20.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>recall warning</p></figcaption></figure>

The message shows back up on the timeline.&#x20;
