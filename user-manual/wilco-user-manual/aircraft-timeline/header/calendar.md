# calendar

In case you would like to research the past events by the date rather than [tags](../tags.md), the calendar is a great way to do it. Click on _calendar button_ situated on the right side of the _search box_ to pop up the calendar view:

Navigation through calendar is quite intuitive - you can click on the month (_ex, August 2023)_ to choose different year/month/day; or just move around with the arrows.&#x20;
