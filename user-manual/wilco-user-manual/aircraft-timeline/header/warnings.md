# warnings

Warnings in the timeline are displayed as all the messages, but their border is orange:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 10.56.37.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on the WARNING button in the timeline header, you can display _only the warnings_ on that aircraft:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 11.13.08.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>only warnings</p></figcaption></figure>

To go back to the full timeline display - click on ALL button (it replaces the WARNING button) on the timeline header.&#x20;

#### Clear WARNINGS in the timeline

First - open the message by clicking on the arrow, situated on the right side of the message:

That will open the feature of the message, when by clicking on CLEAR button (on the top right side of the box), and SAVE button just after (on the bottom right side of the box) - you can clear the warning:&#x20;

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 08.53.53.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>warning dismissed</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Cleared message is dismissed from the timeline, and after refreshing the page, it will no longer be visible on the timeline.&#x20;

#### Show Cleared Warnings

To see the cleared warnings again, click on [SHOW CLEARED](show-cleared.md).
