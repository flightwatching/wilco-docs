#### Aircraft status on timeline

The timeline is clearly indicating whether the message was received on ground (GREY thick line); in flight (BLUE thick line) or undefined (WHITE line), meaning that no dedicated information within the received ACARS message indicates the status if the aircraft is in flight or on ground:
