# dashboards

The dashboards are custom image with SVG graphics (illustrator).

We generally recommend a green cockpit philosophy.

Most of the messages/reports has at least one dashboard associated to it. Most of the customised dashboards are customised!

To get to any dashboard, select aircraft registration on any [fleet dashboard](../fleet-dashboards/) to get to timeline of the aircraft. On the[ aircraft timeline](../aircraft-timeline/), click on the any message title to get to the display of the report.&#x20;
