description: simple way to find the parameter or snapshot information out of report

# search parameter

In the search box, you can look for any parameter: write the full name (_ex.MES1\_IGV_) of the parameter or just a part of it (_ex. IGV_) to filter out all the parameters that contains that part:

Another example: If you're interested in analysing one snapshot of a report (ex. a performance report), you can do that easily using the [search box](../header.md) on the dashboard display.&#x20;

Taking example of a performance report here, the parameters were prefixed with the operating mode (ex. _MES1\__), so that they could be easily found and correlated. Typing MES1\_ in the search box is enough to pre-filter all the parameters by that operating mode:
