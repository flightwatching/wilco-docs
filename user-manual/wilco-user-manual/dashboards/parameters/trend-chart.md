# trend chart

Some _specific zones_ on your dashboard may be  selection-able to get to the _trend chart_. Those zones/buttons are defined at the moment of dashboard design and designed by ADMIN/DESIGNER:

Clicking on that button will take you to pre-defined (yet customisable!) trend chart:

#### overview of trend chart

The trend chart may contain multiple blocks of graphs (here: MES trend, EGT Normalized to 15C, etc).&#x20;

The trend chart is a graph where the horizontal axis is time and the vertical - the parameters. The timestamp is pre-defined, but could be edited on the URL.

Each block has parameters values represented by lines on the graph and the parameter names with its values beside on the left side of each graph. The vertical yellow line follows your mouse move and shows the value of the parameters on all the graphs.&#x20;
